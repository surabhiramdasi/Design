										<h2 class="major">Base Engine Component Design</h2>
										<p>I am experienced with providing design direction for base engine components like cylinder heads, blocks, liners, and sealing components.
											I have expertise in diesel and natural gas engines and I have helped design the overall architecture for blocks and heads along with other auxiliary 
											aspects of the design such as cooling systems, critical fasteners, and gasket sealing requirements. I also work on projects related to Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells
											(PEMFC)	and Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC) where most of my work revolves around developing components in the fuel cell stack in addition to designing the fasteners, enclosures,
											and mounting skids.

										<h2 class="major">Re-design a Rolling Resistance Machine for Tire Testing</h2>
										<p>I worked on modifying a rolling resistance machine into a force and moment testing machine for automotive tires. I designed a loading mechanism to apply a normal force 
											on the tire and a mounting arm to align the tire on the testing drum so as to test the tires at different slip and camber angles. I analyzed the 
											different components of the design to check for various operating conditions and shock loads.

									<div class="content">
										<h2 class="major">Engine Accessory Design</h2>
										<p>I have designed auxiliary engine components like oil pans, flywheel housings, and lifting brackets in the Current Product Improvement space. I curated the Design Verification Plan and Report (DVP&R) for various
											components based on the changes that were being made to the design. I also have experience with designing plumbing options such as coolant lines and oil suction tubes.
											I have employed DFA and DFM principles while working on these designs. I am also familiar with Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and Root Cause Analysis procedures.

										<h2 class="major">Product Development and Project Management</h2>
										<p>I worked as a Product Development Engineer to deliver robust product solutions for external customers. I managed multiple high-impact projects for truck and bus OEMs like Navistar, Paccar,
											New Flyer, Gillig, and Nova Bus spread across different applications in the US, UK, and Canada. I tailored and optimized product solutions for three different engine platforms. I worked on the 
											design release process starting with concept generation to final rollout on the assembly line. I accounted for customer satisfaction by delivering interim solutions, while 
											parallelly developing more concrete alternatives. I collaborated with Cummins manufacturing facilities in North Carolina, New York, and Indiana to understand the installation 
											concerns for prototype parts for different applications, and fixed relevant issues before the final rollout on the assembly line. I collaborated with multiple suppliers and 
											familiarized myself with the manufacturing process for various components like flywheel housings (casting process), oil pans (stamped), breather tubes (plastic molding), etc. I had to assess 
											the reliability of each supplier, and ensure that the inventory delivery timelines are being met. I rallied for cross-functional collaboration and ascertained design, manufacturing, and 
											assembly buy-in from multiple stakeholders through design reviews for critical project milestones. I delivered 90% of my projects on or before time ensuring utmost customer satisfaction
											in most cases.
